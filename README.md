# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview:

Big data is viral in the industry now, for example, for social media, stock markets, and many more.  It’s an extensive, more complex collection than traditional data. Within big data and Hadoop, we learned about MapReduce and how it helped improve the process and handling of big data.  And then, we learned about Byspark, which has become the leader in technology in handling big data.  
Things covered in this module:

  •	Define big data and describe the challenges associated with it.

  •	Define Hadoop and name the main elements of its ecosystem.

  •	Explain how MapReduce processes data.

  •	Define Spark and explain how it processes data.

  •	Describe how NLP collects and analyzes text data.

  •	Explain how to use AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) and relational databases for essential cloud storage.

  •	Complete analysis of an Amazon customer review.

## Analysis:

The purpose of this project was to work on a large project called the “Amazon Vine Program.” The program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews of their products and determine if there is any bias between Vine members and non-Vine members.  Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide free products to Amazon Vine members, who, in return, are required to post a review of the product.  So, To determine if there are any biases in the reviews between Vine members and non-members, we were asked to choose between 50 datasets to extract, transform, and load into a data frame to complete our analysis. 

    1.	We used PySpark to connect to Amazon AWS RDS, extract the dataset, and transfer data.

    2.	Google collab to import Pyspark, connect to PostgreSQL, create tables, and export them.
